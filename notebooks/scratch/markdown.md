Letter from James Quincey

Letter from Our Board of Directors

## Letter from James Quincey

Chief Executive Officer

## On May 8, 1886, a store in Atlanta served the first Coca-Cola.

Today, that now-famous drink forms the foundation for a total beverage company that offers more than 500 brands and 4,300 products worldwide.

While many brands have come and gone during the past 133 years, our success is based in part on our history of investing in the success and sustainability of the communities we call home, from our hometown of Atlanta to more than 200 countries and territories where you can find our products today.

In 2018, we continued to transform our portfolio and, in turn, our company. We delivered strong, geographically balanced revenue growth and value share gains in line with our strategy. There are many highlights, including:

## More innovation, including options with less sugar:

· Globally, sparkling soft drink volume was up 2% in 2018, fueled by double-digit volume growth of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, along with strong performance from new, lowand no-calorie versions of sparkling beverages such as Sprite and Fanta.

·

We launched about 600 new products. Of those, more than 250 were low- or no-sugar, and more than 400 were juices, teas, waters and other non-sparkling beverages.

· Our innovations included Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, now available in multiple markets around the world, and a restage for Diet Coke in North America that included new packaging, marketing and flavors. We launched about 600 new

## Lifting, shifting and scaling brands around the world:

· We used the strength of our distribution system to help launch brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and AdeS across multiple markets with increased speed and agility.

· Worldwide, we expanded 165 products into additional markets in 2018.

## Making strategic investments for the future:

· We strengthened and expanded our portfolio through mergers and acquisitions, including Costa Limited, which closed in early 2019 and gives us a global coffee platform.

· We invested in a strategic partnership with the premium sports hydration brand BODYARMOR, one of the fastestgrowing beverage trademarks in the U.S.

## Investing in the Coca-Cola system advantage:

· We are aligned with our bottling partners to capture growth opportunities. Since 2010, we've invested-with our system-more than $125 billion to strengthen our platform for growth, including technology, such as connected coolers; and in new plants and route-to-market innovation.

· For example, our bottling partner Arca Continental, the first Latin American bottler to operate in the U.S., announced a $250 million investment in a new facility in Texas to help us get more drinks to the market faster.

Letter from James Quincey

Letter from Our Board of Directors

In 2018, we continued to transform our portfolio and, in turn, our company. We delivered strong, geographically balanced revenue growth and value share gains in line with our strategy."

## Building leadership for success and a growth culture:

· We announced several key leadership appointments, including Brian Smith as president and chief operating officer, John Murphy as chief financial officer, and new group and business unit presidents.

· These changes will help us continue to build a culture that fuels our transformation and supports growth worldwide.

· Our new Global Ventures group, led by Jennifer Mann, was created to ensure we connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and brands such as Costa, innocent, Dogadan and Monster.

## Creating Shared Opportunity through Growth

While we're proud of our business results in 2018, companies like ours have a responsibility as leaders. As we grow, we will continue to support local economies and help create economic opportunity.

Our commitment to doing business the right way continued in 2018, as we set out to show the world that the drinks they love can make life more enjoyable, without harming our planet and the natural resources we all depend on.

In early 2018, we announced our World Without Waste initiative with a clear, simple goal: to help collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030. The company's progress during the first year included:

· establishing or joining 10 global recycling/packaging partnerships;

· launching bottles made from 100% recycled materials in multiple markets.

· announcing four packaging technology advancements including the opening of our PlantBottle TM IP for use across the industry; and

We replenished 155% of the water we use in our finished beverages to communities and nature in 2018, continuing to exceed our 2020 goal. We also economically empowered more than 865,000 women in 2018, adding an additional 17 countries.

We don't just recognize our responsibility to be a part of the solution to challenges we all face-we embrace it.

For us, that means using our size, scale and success to create shared opportunity through growth-creating real opportunity for our communities, our customers, our employees and our shareowners.

## Leveraging Data to Help Us Grow Our Business the Right Way

Finally, I am a firm believer in the importance of data. In a digital and data-driven world, good information helps us make better decisions. When we share our data, we can help drive collective accountability for us and others.

In this year's report-our first combined business and sustainability reportwe created a detailed Data Appendix to share more details on our progress

and metrics. This is an idea born from stakeholder engagement and our belief that, working together, we can create a positive impact and respond effectively to the collective challenge of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

We are pleased with our progress against some of our goals, while recognizing that more needs to be done in other areas. We will continue to take action and grow our business the right way-not the easy way.

Sincerely,

James Quincey Chief Executive Officer April 24, 2019

Letter from James Quincey

Letter from Our Board of Directors

Our company's heritage of innovation, growth and value creation includes 133 years of creating beverage brands loved and shared by people around the world.

Today, The Coca-Cola Company is continuing to build on this heritage by opening new horizons for growth as a total beverage company. Our portfolio is evolving and expanding to meet the changing tastes of people around the globe. Our board of directors strongly believes in the bright future of our brands, our business and the positive impact we have, and should have, on local communities.

## New Horizons for Growth

Since becoming CEO in May 2017, James Quincey has led the company in exciting new directions and assembled a strong leadership team with extensive system experience, robust industry and consumer knowledge, and an enhanced focus on innovation and growth. He has also continued our legacy of sustainability with the introduction of the global World Without Waste initiative.

James has demonstrated that he is the right leader to serve as our next board chairman. Our world and our industry are changing rapidly and, as chairman and CEO, James will help The Coca-Cola Company continue to innovate for long-term growth and value creation.

## Accountability for Sustainability

The board's Public Issues and Diversity Review Committee keeps us abreast of the ways broad societal and environmental trends may impact the interests of shareowners and other stakeholders. Throughout the year, the committee receives detailed briefings and updates about progress against our sustainability goals. This is critical to fulfilling its responsibility to provide oversight of the company's sustainability commitments, actions and results.

As we look back on the past decade, we're proud of the Coca-Cola system's sustainability progress. We particularly want to note our progress on water replenishment and women's empowerment.

In 2015, we reached our 2020 target of returning to communities and nature an equivalent amount of the water used in our finished beverages, and we have exceeded our goal every year since. In fact, we have replenished more than 1 trillion liters of water to communities and nature over the past decade.

In 2010, we launched our 5by20 program with the goal of helping to empower 5 million women entrepreneurs by the end of the year 2020. The program is considered one of the most ambitious women's economic empowerment initiatives ever undertaken by a commercial enterprise. By the end of 2018, we had empowered more than 3.2 million women across 92 countries. From the Philippines to South Africa to Poland and beyond, we have provided training, mentorship and other support.

## Looking beyond 2020

Sustainability will of course remain a central focus for our company and our board well beyond 2020. Our longstanding belief is that our business can only be as strong and successful as the communities we serve.

There is an inextricable connection between building a thriving business and strengthening communities. That is one reason we decided to publish a combined business and sustainability report this year. After all, business and sustainability are not separate stories for The Coca-Cola Company-but different facets of the same story.

As we look to our future leadership, we remain a brand business. As a board and a business, we continue to believe that, just as a brand is a promise, a great brand is a promise kept. And we think these words speak to the heart of The Coca-Cola Company and what we're all about.

Our entire board of directors thanks you for your interest in The Coca-Cola Company and for joining us in our ongoing journey of innovation, growth and value creation. Together, let's raise an ice-cold Coke to the bright future ahead!

Very best regards,

1 Our method to track our 58% packaging collection rate against our 2020 goal focused on our predominant package types (glass bottles, steel and aluminum cans, and PET plastic bottles), which make up approximately 85% of our portfolio. Because of new data that we have available to us, our 56% collection rate against our World Without Waste goal takes into account a more inclusive collection rate, representing all of our consumer packaging-including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc. (see p. 24).

2 Our percentage calculations of progress toward collection of 100% of the equivalent of the consumer packaging we sell has been internally vetted using relevant scientific and technical methodologies, but those methodologies are evolving as the industry learns more about calculating collection in different markets. We are working to improve our data collection and measuring systems. As systems and methodologies improve, we will revisit our prior estimates to ensure their accuracy and make any necessary corrections to our public reporting.

Our System in Context

Our business operates within a wider context. We consider this context carefully, and we continuously apply what we learn to manage our impacts, aiming to create shared opportunity as we transform into a total beverage company.

Our short- and long-term success depends on a range of inputs, such as ingredients, water and packaging from our many suppliers, and the talents and passion of our global workforce and system employees. And, of course, our business generates revenue from consumers who provide us with their trust and the financial resources to operate, innovate and grow. As a result, we create a range of outcomes including diverse beverage products; economic benefits such as jobs, taxes paid and community investment; ecosystem impacts and initiatives; and customer and shareowner value.

Our Approach to Managing Our Priorities

Priority Issues: Risks & Opportunities

As a company operating with a growth mindset and a presence in almost every country and territory in the world, we consider our risks and opportunities in a global context.

Many of the issues we face are interconnected and evolving quickly, and we need to understand them to fulfill our long-term vision to grow in a way that creates value for all peopleconsumers, customers, suppliers and communities-while working toward solutions that benefit us all.

Throughout this report we reference our transformation to a total beverage company. There are many issues of relevance to our company, both in relation to this transformation, and more broadly as a global growth business, which we explore in more detail in our key sustainability topics and subsequent pages. The following risk and opportunity areas help provide a snapshot of the global context in which our transformation is taking place.

## Product Innovation

Consumers are adopting healthier diets and lifestyles, which include eating and drinking less sugar, creating demand for a wider range of low- or no-sugar products, and new ingredients, such as plant-based protein. This trend presents a growth opportunity for us, and we listen to consumers as we evolve our long-term business strategy.

Along with the business opportunity, there are also real risks. For example, there is a growing concern among consumers, public health professionals, and government agencies about the increased prevalence of obesity, which is correlated to several noncommunicable diseases. The food and beverage industry has a responsibility to help adequately address these challenges through innovation and new product offerings.

We support the current recommendation by several leading health authorities, including the World Health Organization, that people should limit their daily intake of added sugar to no more than 10% of their total energy/calorie consumption.

## Plastic Waste

Concern about plastic waste has risen sharply as waste collection and recycling infrastructure have not kept pace with plastic manufacturing, causing an increase in plastic waste in the environment. Issues such as changes in local regulations to discourage the use of plastic and the cost of material inefficiencies of linear production models all constitute risks across our global operations. There are hotspots in regions where recycling infrastructure is weakest and/or where ecosystem damage from pollution is most acute, including oceans and coastal areas.

Innovations in packaging materials, such as plant-based raw materials that substitute for petrochemical feedstocks, as well as circular models that turn post-consumer plastics into new, economically viable value streams, present multiple opportunities. These new plastic production models offer improved ecosystem impacts and carbon footprint reductions, accelerate the shift away from single-use plastic, and in some regions also create new employment.

Approximately 14% of plastic packaging-including beverage packaging as well as that of other consumer products-is collected for recycling globally. 1 Our collection rate for non-returnable PET plastic bottles is approximately 52%, in part because PET plastic has a high value relative to other types of plastics. 2

those methodologies are evolving as the industry learns more about calculating collection in different markets. We are working to improve our data collection and measuring systems. As systems and methodologies improve, we will revisit our prior estimates to ensure their accuracy and make any necessary corrections to our public reporting.

Our Approach to Managing Our Priorities

Priority Issues: Risks & Opportunities

## Water Resources

## Climate Change

There are many threats to water quality and availability, including unsustainable agriculture practices, poor sanitation infrastructure, runoff and industrial pollution, and overuse of water resources. Additionally, climate change is exacerbating water scarcity through increased droughts and floods, which in turn impact farmers and other water users who will need to adapt to water stress in many different regions. Our products depend on the availability of high-quality water, as do the people living in the communities where we do business.

By bringing our expertise and other resources to bear, we can ensure that our operations contribute positively to healthy freshwater and marine ecosystems around the world. We can use these same resources to provide access to safe drinking water and sanitation while helping to restore natural water cycles, benefiting multiple aspects of our value chain and the people and communities we serve.

According to the World Economic Forum, water crises have been among the top five global risks in each of the last seven years. 1

There is growing concern that an increase in global average temperatures and the resulting changes to the climate will cause significant disruptions in weather patterns around the globe, creating more frequent and severe natural disasters, including fires, storms an d flo ods. In addition to direct impacts on our operations and communities, this may affect food security and also decrease the agricultural productivity-and/or increase the cost-of key agricultural commodities. Policies that incentivize emissions reductions, and initiatives that reduce deforestation or other negative impacts through land-use changes for food production, are also increasing. These changes are important considerations for companies as they assess CO$_{2}$ emissions in their value chains as well as key supplier relationships. These and other factors combine to create a growin g fin ancial business risk, of which investors and other stakeholders are increasingly aware.

Innovations in ingredients and packaging materials are becoming more scalable, while access to renewable energy is increasingly mainstream. Companies that take advantage of the significant potential of these and other solutions have the opportunity to improve the resilience of their own supply chains, operations and distribution networks, while contributing to greater stability of the planet we all share.

Limiting global warming to below 1.5°C will be required to remain below relevant global risk thresholds-and this will entail rapid and far-reaching transitions in land use, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities. 2

Providing Choice to Consumers

Reducing CaloriesExpanding Portfolio

## Taking Action and Expanding Choice

People's tastes and preferences are changing, so we're changing, too.

Driven by our passion for consumers, we have been shifting our mindset and culture, as well as the way we measure our success, resulting in bold action to transform our portfolio.

Gradually reducing sugar across our entire portfolio 1

Making smaller, more convenient packages so controlling sugar intake is easier

Offering more new drinks that provide benefits like nutrition and hydration

Giving people the information they need to make informed choices

1 To maintain consumer acceptance and avoid moving so far that consumers substitute higher sugar alternatives, it is widely accepted that reformulation is a gradual process.

2 This does not include calories from non-sugar ingredients such as protein or fat.

3 Due to regulations affecting 100% natural juices, natural sugars must be left intact to be classified as 100% juice.

## Using Data to Reduce Sugar and Calories

Around the world, consuming less sugar is an increasingly important issue for many people.

To meet these changing consumer needs, we have updated our approach to more effectively measure our sugar and calorie reduction efforts. Since our CEO-led Our Way Forward initiative was launched in 2017, we have been aggressively reformulating recipes to reduce sugar, using our marketing muscle to promote low- and no-calorie beverage options and investing along with our system to make smaller packages more available. We have also been accelerating the expansion of beverage options across our portfolio.

Just as we harness data and analytics to inform and improve our growth efforts at scale, we also track our sugar and calorie reduction efforts from market to market.

We keep track of metrics resulting from the sugar reduction levers we are using, such as total calories from sugar-both added and natural sugars-across all of our brands, 2 sugar reductions from a combination of new recipes, 3 promotion of low- and no-calorie beverages, and reduced package sizes.

The cumulative effect of these actions is lowering the average calories per package in our portfolio.

## Putting Consumers First

We're exploring and bringing to market new sugar alternatives that help us keep the great tastes people love but with less sugar and fewer calories. For example, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar realized double-digit volume growth in 2018 globally as we continued to invest as a system in marketing and promotions of this zero-calorie sparkling product innovation.

We're also heavily promoting our low- and no-sugar drinks, making them more visible and easier to find. And we're bringing drinks like organic tea, coconut water, juices, purified water and beyond to more people in more places.

## Smaller, More Convenient Packages

Smaller, more convenient packaging helps people control sugar intake more easily for themselves and their families.

· Today, about 44% of our sparkling soft drink brands come in convenient packages of 250 mL (8.5 oz.) or less.

· Smaller packages of sparkling soft drinks in North America again posted double-digit growth led by 7.5-ounce mini cans of sparkling soft drinks like Coca-Cola and Sprite.

More than 30% growth for mini cans in North America in 2018.*

* Nielsen AMC.

## Responding to Local Conditions to Reduce Sugar

We are taking action on sugar reduction even where it means changes to our most popular, time-tested products-putting our strength in innovation to work for our consumers' evolving needs.

Coca-Cola Chile's portfolio is now composed of 95% low- and nocalorie beverages representing a significant reduction in sugar and calories. The Coca-Cola system removed the equivalent of 33,000 tons of sugar from the market through recipe changes across our Chilean beverage portfolio.

Coca-Cola Singapore launched new Sprite and Fanta Orange recipes in 2018, which contain more than 40% less sugar without compromising on taste. In Japan, we continued to offer no-sugar product varieties including Ayataka FOSHU tea and Japan Craftsman Black (no-sugar) coffee.

The commitment we made along with the European soft drinks industry to reduce the average added sugar content of still and carbonated soft drinks by 10% has led to 16 national sugar reduction pledges in the EU to date, and counting.

For information about our innovative sugar reduction in Mexico, see p. 20.

## Offering More New Drinks

We're making reduced-sugar products more available through reformulation. We've reformulated hundreds of products around the world. We're also making our zero-sugar products taste better. and promoting them more. As we take these actions, consumers are responding positively in the sense that they are accepting sugarreduced products at a good rate. We also see growth in our zerosugar portfolio as well as in smaller pack sizes."

ROBERT LONG Chief Innovation Officer

## Delivering Strategic Growth

Prioritizing consumers' preferences means identifying strategic acquisitions and investments in emerging brands. In 2018, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Costa Limited. Costa is the leading coffee company in the United Kingdom and has a footprint in more than 30 countries in the fast-growing coffee category. We also acquired a minority ownership stake in BODYARMOR, a sports drink that contains potassium and other electrolytes, vitamins and coconut water, with no artificial colors or flavors.

2018 Business & Sustainability Report

We're looking for ways, whenever we can, to make many of our beverages better and more nutritious by providing vitamins, minerals and electrolytes, while also introducing more dairy, plant-based beverages and different sweetness level options to meet an increasing range of consumer choices. With this in mind, we launched more than 600 products in 2018 including:

· Sprite Fiber+, a no-sugar drink with dietary fiber and the flavor and refreshment consumers expect from Sprite, was launched in China.

· smartwater alkaline, which is ionized to ensure the pH level is 9+, was launched in select U.S. markets.

· Coca-Cola Batch Blends Coffee and Chocolate, a no-sugar beverage combining refreshing Coca-Cola taste with chocolate and real coffee from Brazil, was launched in Vietnam.

## Giving People Information

We continue to put clear, easy-to-find nutrition information right up front to support informed choices, without the guesswork.

We lead the food and beverage industry in voluntary front-of-package calorie labeling. For example, in Europe, we are introducing trials of color-coded nutrition labelling to help people know exactly what is in the drinks they enjoy. Our labels build on a scheme that is already familiar to more than 500 million people across the European Union, adding red, amber and green colors to the numbers for key nutrients (fats, saturated fat, salt, sugar).

## Responsible Marketing

We do not target our advertising to children under age 12, anywhere in the world. Examples of this longstanding policy in action include:

· We do not place advertising in media where the audience is comprised of over 35% children under 12 years old, including television shows, print media, websites, social media, movies, SMS/email marketing, animation, third-party characters, celebrities/games/contests, branded toys/merchandise, talent selection, point of sale, and merchandise items.

· We work with industry platforms such as the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA), World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), the EU Pledge initiative, Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) and others to put meaningful actions in place to reduce the exposure of children to advertising of all products high in fat, salt or sugar.

· We do not design our marketing communications in a way that appeals primarily to children under 12.

· We evolve our commitments to respond to changing societal concerns, including advertising on digital platforms, and work with local industry to join these framework commitments and scale collective actions.

· We openly participate in audits by external organizations that monitor our advertising to demonstrate compliance with our standards and all relevant authorities.

## Refreshingly Less Sugar

Nothing is off the table in our pursuit of reducing sugar while keeping the great tastes people love. This includes our marquee brand-Coca-Cola, affectionately known as "Coke." Everything we do starts with our passion for what people want. Today and going forward, one of those things is less sugar. In this necessary and exciting transformation, we're rethinking many of our recipes and reducing the sugar content in our brands around the world to help us achieve growth.

## INVOLVEMENT

in 2018 with additional markets planned for 2019

Our global innovation teams, always looking to reduce calories without sacrificing taste, regularly conduct extensive consumer testing. The fact that consumers love Coca-Cola but are also increasingly interested in consuming less sugar presents both a strategic imperative and an opportunity for our business to do more. In several markets around the world, we tested an idea that could even further reduce sugar in our beverage offerings.

A key pilot program in calorie reduction included Mexico-an important market as the leader in per capita consumption of our products, and a country where 75 brands and 45% of our portfolio are low- or no-sugar options. We rigorously tested a new recipe for Coca-Cola with 30% fewer calories created in our Mexico R&D lab. We then applied our iterative, deliberate approach to launch and scale the product while applying learnings.

The new recipe performed well among consumers in terms of overall taste compared to Coca-Cola Original Taste in Mexico and other markets. And these consumers expressed a strong willingness to replace the current formulation with the new one, Coca-Cola Original Taste Less Sugar.

In taking on sugar reduction in our leading brands, we seek to both follow and lead the consumer on this journey. There is no "one size fits all" so we innovate market by market. We are looking to scale this idea further and accelerate our sugar reduction efforts by extending this approach in more markets.

After extensive consumer testing, we launched with a phased approach across Mexico that included tracking results and real-time planning to respond to the market, focusing on the most important occasion in volume for our consumer base: meals. The new bottles displayed the key message on the label: 'Delicious and Refreshing, Now with Less Sugar.'"

## WORLD WITHOUT WASTE

## Make Packaging Waste a Thing of the Past

Though the packaging waste challenge wasn't new to us, 2017 was a pivotal year. We took a fresh look at the issueand did not like what we saw. Plastic bottles, cans and other containers kept ending up in our oceans and waterways or littering our communities. While we had made great strides in recyclability through the years, we realized we had to do more to make sure our packages are collected and recycled.

OUR INTENT is to dramatically reduce the impact of packaging waste on the environment. To drive results, we are:

· partnering with key stakeholders including our bottling partners, NGOs, regulators, retailers, local communities and even our competitors.

· developing more complete data and metrics which take into account all consumer packaging and a broader array of beverage containersincluding beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches for the first time (see p. 24).

* Our method to track our 58% packaging collection rate against our 2020 goal focused on our predominant package types (glass bottles, steel and aluminum cans and PET plastic bottles), which make up approximately 85% of our portfolio. Because of new data that we have available to us, our 56% collection rate against our World Without Waste goals takes into account a more inclusive collection rate, representing all of our consumer packaging-including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc. (see p. 24).

In January 2018, we established three fundamental goals:

## 1 DESIGN

Make our packaging 100% recyclable globally by 2025-and use at least 50% recycled material in our packaging by 2030.

· 88% of The Coca-Cola Company's consumer packaging is recyclableup from 85% in early 2018.*

· 30% recycled material was used in our packaging globally in 2018.

## 2 COLLECT

Collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030.

· 58% of the equivalent bottles and cans we introduced into the market in 2018 were refilled, collected or recycled.*

· Taking additional packaging types into consideration, that rate was 56% for 2018.*

## 3 PARTNER

Bring people together to support a healthy, debris-free environment.

· $15 million was committed in 2018 to invest in Circulate Capital, an investment management firm dedicated to incubating and financing companies and infrastructure that prevent the flow of plastic waste into the world's oceans.

Data Appendix

In 2018, we launched World Without Waste-a system-wide effort to design more recyclable packaging, increase collection and partner with communities, NGOs and even our competitors to reduce packaging waste. We are measuring and tracking against this goal and will continue to evaluate ourselves on how we can do more, better, and faster."

## BEA PEREZ

Senior Vice President and Chief Communications, Public Affairs, Sustainability and Marketing Assets Officer, The Coca-Cola Company

## Designing Waste Out of the System

We are radically rethinking how we produce, recycle and reuse our packaging-and even how we get our products to consumers in the first place.

Technological advances and innovation are helping us identify different and smarter ways to use plastic and to recycle it. For example, in 2018, we announced bottles made from 100% recycled plastic in multiple markets. In many other countries and territories we're working with governments to find ways to increase the use of recycled materials in packaging sold in their markets.

In 2018, we announced four key technology partnerships:

· Expanded access to our PlantBottle intellectual property to all-even our competitors-to foster further innovation. PlantBottles have up to 30% plant-based materials, reducing the bottle's carbon footprint.

· Established a framework with Loop Industries for authorized bottlers to purchase 100% recycled PET plastic.

· Entered into a loan agreement with Ioniqa Technologies to transform hard-to-recycle plastic waste into high-quality, food-grade PET plastic.

· Joined the Industrial Advisory Board of DEMETO, a European chemical recycling consortium working to bring to reality a revolutionary new way to chemically recycle PET.

## Recycle 24/7

## Thinking Locally

The 200+ countries and territories in which we operate present widely varying challenges and opportunities in meeting our recycling goals. Bottle and can recycling rates differ dramatically, as does the infrastructure in place and even the quality of recycling data that could help us improve. The solutions to boost recycling are as varied as the countries themselves, so we seek local partners to pilot solutions. Then, as we do with popular new products, we "lift, shift and scale" to adapt successful solutions in other markets.

Each of our business units has a plan in place to help achieve our World Without Waste goals-a plan tailored to the realities and unique needs of their local markets. In some countries, the challenges have to do with getting the right collection systems and processing facilities in place. In other parts of the world, collection and recycling is powered more by people than machines. In those areas, our approach has been to help formalize the recycling sector with appropriate sensitivity to human rights issues and decent livelihoods.

## Acting Locally

In Estonia, where Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company enhanced postconsumer packaging collection and engaged in anti-littering and other public-education campaigns, the municipal waste recycling rate jumped from 17.9% to 31.3% in a single year.

In Brazil, we are investing about $25 million to launch "a universal bottle," which is a returnable package that can be refilled with any flavor.

Refillables already make up 20% of packages in Brazil and our goal is to raise that to 50% by 2030.

Coca-Cola Vietnam, together with industry, nongovernmental organizations and government partners, launched a new initiative to implement a circular economy approach in Ho Chi Minh City, within the framework of the Vietnam Centre for Circular Economy.

In North America, The Coca-Cola Foundation is investing to help create seven "model collection markets" to increase recycling participation in communities with existing recycling infrastructure in place.

## The Climate-Waste Connection

Packaging-related greenhouse gases comprise around 35% of the carbon footprint of "the drink in your hand." We project that increased recycling, use of refillable bottles, plant-based plastics and other solutions will contribute significantly to meeting our climate goal.

Our system's PetStar facility in Mexico is the world's largest food-grade PET recycling plant.

See our World Without Waste: 2018 Progress Report.

## A World of Differences

Recycling rates for PET packaging vary widely around the world. A major driver of the variability is the complex assortment of collection and recycling systems and infrastructure in place. In some countries, governments run the systems, while in other countries, industry leads on a voluntary or mandatory basis. Deposit-return systems may also coexist with government and industry-led infrastructure. Informal, scavenger-based systems are common in some places, and we estimate that approximately 100 countries have no system at all.

## Representative Non-Refillable PET Beverage Packaging Collection Rates

SOUTH AFRICA 65%

## Inventing a Zero-Waste Urban Environment

In 2018, The Coca-Cola Company launched "Zero Waste Cities," a new program that aims to make Thessaloniki the first city in Greece with the potential to become a zero-waste municipality. Among the program's innovations is "Print Your City." Through an online platform, residents can nominate useful objects that will be 3D printed using plastic waste and installed in various neighborhoods across the city. The first

10 pieces of functional urban furniture demonstrating the concept were placed at the Thessaloniki seaside. Other program elements include a Coca-Cola Foundation-funded waterfront cleanup, outreach and education, a waste collection system, and the first-ever prevention study on how the city can better handle its waste. We plan to roll the program out to additional cities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

See additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.

## Partnering to Tackle Collective Challenges

Tackling plastic waste challenges requires thinking and action from the best and the brightest, including others in the industry, the public sector and civil society. We have established or joined 10 global partnerships that will help us achieve our World Without Waste goals, including:

· The World Economic Forum's Global Plastic Action Partnership, which fosters collaboration to tackle plastic waste issues.

· The Coca-Cola Foundation-supported Ocean Conservancy and its Trash Free Seas program, which work to invest in trash collection and recycling systems to make sure trash never gets in the ocean. Since 1995, 220 million pounds of trash have been removed from more than 375,000 miles of coastline through this partnership with Ocean Conservancy. · The Packaging and Recycling Association for Indonesia Sustainable Environment (PRAISE) , which aims to support integrated and sustainable packaging waste solutions in Indonesia (see p. 25).

· Ellen MacArthur Foundation/ UN Environment New Plastics Economy Global Commitment , which focuses on framing the circular economy as an innovation opportunity, moving beyond traditional risk mitigation thinking, based on a shared vision and concrete, timebound targets.

## Driving Results with Better Data

As we implemented our World Without Waste initiative in 2018, we also updated our data collection and tracking procedures to ensure we had the most meaningful metrics in place to help drive collective action and progress to meet our goals. Since packaging collection is by nature a local process, we shifted data collection to our global business units. Our local teams and bottling partners have plans and responsibility for both making progress and measuring that progress toward our systemwide goals.

That means, on a country-by-country level, we are holding our business leaders accountable for doing business the right way. Our intent is to increase collection rates for every package type in our portfolio, in every market.

Previously, our method to track collection focused on our predominant package types (glass bottles, steel and aluminum cans and PET plastic bottles), which make up approximately 85% of our portfolio. According to this method, our main package types served as a proxy for all our packaging. Using that calculation methodology, our collection rate for 2018 is 58%.*

## More Inclusive Collection Data

Because of new data that we have available to us, we are able to report a more inclusive collection rate, taking into account all consumer packaging -including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc. Our 2018 collection rate inclusive of all consumer packaging is 56%, which means that 56% of all our packaging is either refilled or collected for recycling.

## NUMBER OF PACKAGES INTRODUCED IN 2018

were collected, recycled or refilled, when taking into account additional packaging types.

## Accounting for Our Packages

Historically, we reported our packaging mix (the percentage of each packaging type we introduce into the marketplace) based on a volume metric (unit cases). This was a way to simply align commonly used volume indicators with the packaging types we sold. According to this methodology, a two-liter plastic bottle would represent a greater share of packaging mixperhaps more than triple-than a twenty-ounce plastic bottle, because it contains more liquid. We continue to evolve our data approach as we move our focus as an organization from volume to value.

Moving forward, we have decided to report a packaging mix measure that better reflects the actual breakdown of the number of packages we introduce into the marketplace. The new methodology for packaging mix is based on individual units of packaging sold. This means that a twenty-ounce bottle and a two-liter bottle would represent an equal share of packaging mix. We believe that this will help us as we collectively strive to achieve more meaningful progress against World Without Waste goals.

The graphic to the left represents the number of packages introduced globally in 2018 by package type. Our 2018 packaging mix can be found in our Data Appendix .

## PRAISE: Transforming Waste into Value in Indonesia

According to Ocean Conservancy, Indonesia is the world's second-largest source of ocean plastic.* We are working to transform this challenge into widely shared opportunity through PRAISE, the Packaging and Recycling Association for Indonesia Sustainable Environment. This strategic partnership of industry leaders has a bold 2030 vision: to bring economic, social and environmental benefits to Indonesia by transforming packaging waste into a high-value resource.

PRAISE has helped formulate Indonesia's first packaging collection and recycling initiatives. This aligns with our World Without Waste vision-helping to enable a collective and holistic approach involving stakeholders across the packaging value chain working toward a circular economy model.

Low collection rates remain a major challenge in Indonesia due to lack of collection infrastructure and awareness. To spur structural and behavioral change, PRAISE's Drop Box program has placed 100 collection bins across Jakarta, supported by online and offline public education. Each drop box is divided into paper and non-paper recyclables, which Waste4Change-an Indonesian social enterprise-collects, transports, and manages. Through additional support, we helped place another 100 drop boxes in locations in Bekasi, outside Jakarta.

PRAISE also manages Bali Bersih (Clean Bali), a pilot program that seeks to support and enable communitybased recycling and reuse to minimize the amount of waste that ends up in the surrounding seas.

## Partnering

The six founding members of PRAISE include Coca-Cola Indonesia, local food and beverage giant Indofood, and leading global companies Unilever, Danone, Nestlé and Tetra Pak. We play an active role in strategy and in implementation. Our local Coca-Cola packaging director sits on the PRAISE steering committee, as does the CEO of Coca-Cola Foundation Indonesia.

PRAISE launched its Drop Box initiative in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia, DKI Jakarta Environmental Service, and Waste4Change, and directly involves local stakeholders such as schools, retailers, mosques, churches, offices and others.

It was a wake-up call to everyone in Indonesia when we were listed as one of the top 5 'leaking countries' for plastics. We worked together with everyone-government, concerned citizens, NGOs and industry, even our competitorsto take bold action. PRAISE is a critical forum driven by our desire to improve collection for all plastics. Our efforts will drive results and impact across our region."

WATER LEADERSHIP

## Building on a Decade of Water Replenishment

The Coca-Cola Company's water leadership was born in India more than a decade ago, following a conflict between our business and the local community over the use of local water resources. While we believed we had a solid record of using water efficiently and responsibly, we quickly learned what is now well-accepted: that the availability of freshwater is a defining issue of our times-one that poses risks to a company's license to operate. It also offers opportunities to make a positive impact on lives and livelihoods around the globe.

That moment led us to examine and better understand water risks to our company and the communities in which we operate, looking well beyond the four walls of our facilities and into our supply chain. It also led to our pioneering goal, established 10 years ago, to replenish the water we used in the production of our beverages. At the time, the goal was a leap of faith. But we met and exceeded it, and other companies have followed suit. As our understanding of water risks and opportunities continues to evolve, we are refining our approach to continue our leadership and further align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Our Company

## Water Is Critical for Our Entire Value Chain

Water is needed to grow our agricultural ingredients. It is used in manufacturing and essential in our products. And it is a shared resource: Adequate, clean freshwater is vital to our consumers and the communities they live in. Yet billions of people lack basic access to clean water and sanitation. And as an increase in global average temperatures continues to result in changes to the climate, we can expect more droughts, floods, storms and wildfires that create water-related risks for our business and people all along the value chain.

The foundation of our water stewardship work is our comprehensive risk mitigation strategy that assesses water stress at each plant in our system and in the surrounding communities. The assessments give us a deep understanding of local conditions

and current and future water risks. They also provide the basis for the water management plans that each facility in our system develops and implements to address the risks and opportunities identified.

Over a decade ago, we established our water leadership framework of Protect, Reduce, Recycle, Replenish and set our goal to replenish 100% of the water used in our finished beverages back to communities and nature. We defined how progress against the goal would be measured using peer-reviewed scientific and technical methods. The replenish projects we support focus on improving safe access to water for human consumption and sanitation; protecting watersheds by improving water capture, storage and quality; and providing water for productive use, such as increased water availability or water efficiency in farming.

## Partnering for Progress

· Some of the global partners in our water work are the World Wildlife Fund , 2030 Water Resources Group , The Nature Conservancy and the Global Water PartnershipMediterranean. In 2007, The Coca-Cola Company joined the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate, and was an active member of the Mandate's Action Platform in 2018.

· Our local access to water and sanitation programs are implemented by partners such as Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP), WaterAid , CARE , Water For People and local utilities and services providers with the support of co-funders such as USAID through the Water and Development Alliance , One Drop , and Inter-American Development Bank .

Our 2018 CDP Water disclosure placed us in the leadership range of scores (A-) by providing detailed data and information about how we manage water across our value chain.

## Water and Communities

· 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services.*

· About 4 billion people , representing nearly two-thirds of the world population, experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year.*

· 4.5 billion people lack safely managed sanitation services.*

## Water and Our System

· By 2030, the impacts of climate change will further increase risks to availability and quality of local water resources for our bottling operations and ingredient sourcing regions, including in key markets such as the U.S., Mexico, India, Pakistan and others.

## The Benefits of Water Access to Women

Women carry the greatest burden from the lack of access to safe drinking water, spending an estimated 200 million hours every day fetching water-time that could be better used, including on economic activities.* In 2018, USAID, The Coca-Cola Company and Water and Development Alliance* collaborated with research firm Ipsos to conduct the Ripple Effect Study, which rigorously assessed how improved access to water and sanitation enables women's empowerment, and promotes gender equality. The study identified eight pathways to empowerment, including improvements in women's health, income, nutrition, safety and security, education, leadership and skills, time savings, and shifts in community roles and gender norms. The study and a related research hub can be found here .

## Replenishing Cape Town in a Time of Drought

As Cape Town faced the impending threat of "Day Zero"the day its water reserves would run dry-an innovative ecological intervention to improve how fast and fully the upstream Atlantis aquifer could replenish itself began in early 2018. Funded by the Greater Cape Town Water Fund and implemented by The Nature Conservancy with support from RAIN, the Replenish Africa Initiative of The Coca-Cola Foundation, the program is improving the lives of local residents while increasing water security across Cape Town's water supply system. The program is also creating economic opportunities for women on the front lines of the restoration effort.

in greater Cape Town area gaining increased water security

By removing invasive species from an aquifer's primary recharge zone and restoring local vegetation, more water can be made available to communities downstream. This nature-based, restorative approach is the first project being funded by the Greater Cape Town Water Fund, which was funded through RAIN. The guiding principle of such public-private water funds is that it costs less to prevent water problems at the source than to address them downstream.

This innovative funding mechanism aims to improve long-term water security in the Greater Cape Town area.

Tapping into municipal jobs listing services, the project hired a team of women from the local communities of Atlantis, Mamre and Pella, bringing welcome opportunities to a region where unemployment is high. Preparation for the work of clearing and restoring the vegetation included handtool and chainsaw training, and a mentorship contractor provided skilled workers to work side-by-side

with the local team. The women take pride in their new skills and in helping to address this widely shared need of freshwater replenishment.

## Partnering to Prevent Crisis

In the face of ongoing water stress and droughts, large cities like Cape Town need long-term solutions to climatic variability. RAIN invested $150,000 in the Greater Cape Town Water Fund to catalyze its formation and pilot project. To ensure transparency and sensitivity to community needs, the project engages with government officials for the City of Cape Town and the National Department of Environmental Affairs, environmental specialists from Cape Nature and other local stakeholders. Furthermore, The Coca-Cola Foundation also plays a strategic role as a member of the fund's steering committee. The foundation of FEMSA, our largest independent bottling company, has also partnered with The Nature Conservancy to create similar water funds supporting 24 projects in eight Latin American countries.

Alien plant invasions in the Greater Cape Town region's catchments are responsible for the loss of 38 million liters of water each year, equivalent to meeting the water requirements of Cape Town for two months. The Greater Cape Town Water Fund is committed to working with partners to control thirsty invader plants, restore strategic wetlands and riverine areas, and thereby address these water losses."

## SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

## On the Journey to More Sustainable Ingredients

Ingredients are at the heart of our products, and our transformation into a total beverage company is also expanding the variety of ingredients we use. We source a wide range of agricultural commodities-including fruit juices, coffee, tea, sugar and soy, as well as special ingredients such as herbs and dairy-based ingredientsfrom a complex supply chain that spans the globe. Ensuring that these ingredients are produced in a way that respects farmworkers and communities and protects natural resources is a top priority for our company.

We are making good progress. Since 2013, when we set our 2020 goal to sustainably source our 14 global priority ingredients, the percentage of ingredients certified to a sustainable agriculture standard has grown from 8% to 44%.

Priority ingredients represent the vast majority of our total agricultural ingredient purchases.

Increase from

in ingredients certified to a sustainability standard over five years

8% to 44%

## Our Approach

For The Coca-Cola Company, "sustainably sourced" means that ingredients sourced from our farm suppliers meet standards for human and workplace rights, environmental protection and responsible farming management that are set out in our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP). We have worked with our suppliers to help them demonstrate that they meet the SAGP criteria by using the leading global sustainable agriculture standards for the commodities and products they provide to our company.

Bonsucro and Rainforest Alliance are among the leading sustainable farming standards we support.

Indian mango supplier Foods & Inns was the first company in India to certify farmers using Sustainable Agriculture Initiative's Farm Sustainability Assessment (SAI-FSA) Silver in 2018 (see p. 32).

## The Path Ahead

Together with our bottling partners and suppliers, we have made a lot of progress on driving and demonstrating sustainable agricultural practices in our ingredients supply chain. But we know that we still have a long way to go to achieve our goal. Over the past five years, we have learned that certification is not the only way to help farmers continuously improve their practices and become more sustainable. Farm sizes, environmental conditions and social practices differ widely in our global supply chain. For example, there are some 5 million smallholder farmers providing ingredients to our system, often through several intermediaries. Smallholders, many of whom are women, are particularly vulnerable to water and climate fluctuations-interconnected global issues that impact their livelihoods and the stability of our supply base.

We will continue to build on what we've learned and develop a variety of ways to achieve sustainable ingredients sourcing, engaging all farmers in our supply chain on this journey. This includes sharing knowledge and tools with farmers and investing in our supply chain to support a diverse and resilient agricultural supply. We focus where the risks are greatest to help align goals across our supply chain and support the development of standards where they are lacking.

Our major orange juice supplier, Cutrale in Brazil, assured its own farms against the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative's Farm Sustainability Assessment (SAI-FSA) Gold and Silver.

## Sustainable Citrus in Sicily

In Sicily, The Coca-Cola Company is taking a holistic approach to supporting a sustainable supply chain for the citrus used in Fanta, focusing on water, waste, climate resilience and employment. For example, in partnership with the Citrus Fruit District and with technological support from the Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change, farmers participating in the pilot project receive real-time information on irrigation needs from sensors installed in their orchards.

Climate Change

## Examining Issues in the Sugar Supply Chain

During 2018, we conducted six studies of human rights issues, including child labor, forced labor and land rights, in countries from which we source sugar. These third-party reports are among 18 we have completed on the way to meeting our commitment to conduct 28 country studies. We have followed up on findings of the studies through initiatives including bringing brands together to provide better access to clean water and sanitation at a sugar mill in Mexico and participating in a multi-stakeholder convening on land rights in Malawi.

18 studies completed including 6 in 2018

The Citrus Fruit District in Sicily is vital for us, as Fanta Orange in Italy-born in the country in 1955-is made with the juice of oranges from the region.

## Sustainable Growth for India's Smallholder Farmers and Our Portfolio

India produces more mangos than any country on earth, mostly from small farms. These growers often face economic challenges for their basic subsistence, so prioritizing more long-term sustainable practices can be difficult. Due to the sheer number of people involved where small growers are the predominant source of agricultural supply, there are a variety of challenges. Our work collaborating with mango growers has seen remarkable results in a few short years, both for the farmers and for our business as we seek to accelerate the growth of our portfolio of sustainably sourced, fruit-based beverages across the region.

Our mango sustainability program began in 2015 in collaboration with one of our key suppliers, Foods & Inns Ltd (F&I), and other partners. Farmers were provided tools, training and best practices in integrated pest management and crop handling. Farmers also benefit from a purposebuilt network of F&I direct supply collection centers, allowing them to avoid trader commissions or "mandi" (transport, weighing and unloading charges).

Today, F&I is ready to supply all the mangos we buy from them as sustainably certified-a key factor in our growth plan for our India juice portfolio. The mangos go into products for Maaza in India and Minute Maid in the U.S. and Europe.

More farmers have approached us to join the sustainability program, which is a testament to its success. This proof that small grower sustainable sourcing is achievable informs our growing investment in the fruit supply chain in India and efforts to make it globally competitive, as we seek to build a stable supply while promoting practices that improve people's lives and livelihoods.

## Partnering

The success of this project arises from the efforts a variety of partners, from F&I who invested money, time, effort and experience, to the Ford Foundation who funded the initial seed money, to Technoserve who conducted a diagnostic study. Subjectmatter-expert partnerships include the State Bank of India for farmer financing, Bayer Crop Sciences for integrated pest management, Aries Agro for soil nutrient management, Cropin Technologies for mobile recording and data collection, and Solidaridad for capacity building and record management. This program complements our $1.7 billion investment over five years in the productivity and circularity of the Indian fruit economy that is expected to help support 200,000 farmers in elevating their practices, in alignment with the Indian government's goals.

Foods & Inns and Coca-Cola have really helped us, not only in improving our practices and productivity, but also in the transport and direct purchase of our produce."

## Supporting Human Rights

At The Coca-Cola Company, respect for human rights is ingrained in our culture and guides our interactions with employees, bottling partners, suppliers, customers, consumers and the communities we serve. To ensure that our approach is comprehensive, and as part of our ongoing effort to meet stakeholders' expectations, our policies and practices are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Our human rights commitment starts with our own employees, making sure they have safe, supportive and respectful workplaces where the dignity of every associate is recognized. Our Human Rights Policy , updated in 2017 following consultation with more than 180 stakeholders globally, sets the framework for ensuring that we meet this commitment within our owned operations and those over

which we have management control. Tools and training are provided to help our global operations abide by the policy. We encourage our employees to report any possible violations of the policy through multiple channels, including an ethics hotline.

Our suppliers and system partners are also expected to embrace responsible workplace practices. Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP), aligned with our Human Rights Policy, are a part of all contractual agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and our direct and authorized suppliers. We have developed guidance on specific topics and, in 2018, we provided 22 training programs to bottlers, suppliers and auditors across the world to help them uphold the values outlined in the SGP.

## Identifying Human Rights Issues

We have worked to identify, map and prioritize potential human rights risks across our value chain. Our vast supply chain is where many of the identified human rights risks may occur. These include, for example, migrant and child labor in agriculture. Other issues, such as working conditions in the informal recycling sector, may be present in certain geographies and require partnership with organizations in the private and public sectors and civil society to address in a systemic way.

To dig deeper, in 2013 we committed to conduct 28 studies by 2020 that focus on child labor, forced labor and land rights in key sugar supply markets (see p. 31).

Our Human Rights Report identifies 12 salient issues and provides detailed information on our approach.

## TRACKING PROGRESS

At the end of 2018, audits found 96 percent of company-owned facilities in full compliance with our Human Rights Policy. The remaining facilities are working on action plans for alignment in the near term.

Audits of suppliers and independent bottlers were conducted worldwide to verify compliance with our Supplier Guiding Principles:

## Empowering Women

Women around the world have long been important contributors to the Coca-Cola business system, and they often face significant barriers to realizing their own economic empowerment.

Studies show that the economic empowerment of women has positive multiplier effects on the nutrition, health and education of families, 1 and that better inclusion of women in the world economy propels growth and prosperity. 2

In 2010, The Coca-Cola Company made a commitment to economically empower 5 million women by 2020 through our 5by20 initiative. We partner with governments and NGOs to address specific barriers to business success that women entrepreneurs face. These programs meet women where they are-in their communities, businesses and online-and provide

enabling activities that include: business skills training, financial services and/or assets, and peer-topeer mentoring networks.

Across diverse geographies including developed and developing countries, 5by20 has supported the success of individual women and shown how gender-balanced entrepreneurship can increase economic resilience.

Since 2016, nearly 200,000 women have been trained and empowered through "Success is ME," the biggest and most comprehensive professional activation program for women in Poland. The Coca-Cola Foundation and the Success Written in Lipstick Foundation support job seekers and entrepreneurs through online courses, lectures and workshops. Evaluations show that 98.7% of users would recommend Success is ME to their friends.

## Employee Safety & Health

A safe and healthy workplace is a fundamental right of every person and also a business imperative.

Our Workplace Rights Policy requires that we take responsibility for maintaining a productive workplace by minimizing the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health hazards for all of our associates and contractors. In addition, we work with our bottling partners to help ensure health and safety risks are minimized for their employees and contract workers.

## Embedding Health & Safety Across Our Operations

We seek to embed and improve health and safety across all aspects of our business. For example, we developed a Behavioral Based Safety program for the Coca-Cola system and suppliers

to adopt into their operations. This program incorporates the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to examine why injuries occur and to analyze the influencers in the management system that may allow at-risk behaviors.

Our Quality, Safety & Environment (QSE) capability team has implemented programs designed to improve operational performance, such as the QSE Professional Excellence Program, an intensive training and development program, and the QSE College which provides online quality, safety and environmental training for business units of the company, as well as bottling partners globally.

Additionally, our Coca-Cola Operating Requirements (KORE) define the policies, standards and requirements for managing safety, the environment and quality throughout our operations. KORE goes beyond compliance to require that our manufacturing and distribution facilities implement two internationally recognized frameworks of occupational health and safety management systems and requirements designed to improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks and create better, safer working conditions, all over the world.

To support these programs and ensure continuous improvement, we also regularly conduct unannounced audits, including 237 in 2018, across our direct operations and bottling partners.

## Improving Route-to-Market Safety

Our safety program addresses the movement of products and people between our bottling plants and our customers. Because everything from cars and trucks to canoes and motorcycles is used to distribute our products, often involving third-party partners, solutions must be developed and implemented at a local level.

Route-to-market safety encompasses the downstream storage and distribution of our products, as well as any movement of employees along public roadways. Bottling partners assess the risks involved with routes, and they ensure our drivers understand how to avoid collisions or incidents.

At the community level, The Coca-Cola Company is an active Board Member of the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, a group of organizations that have similar fleet operations, to learn global best practices to improve infrastructure and operational behaviors.

## Coca-Cola Turkey Operations Recognized Externally in Safety Leadership

Coca-Cola Turkey operations were recognized by the British Safety Council for their dedication to excellent health, safety and well-being in 2018. In collaboration with our bottling partners, Coca-Cola Içecek, we focused on creating a culture that emphasizes a safe and healthy environment. In our Dogadan Tea facility, we implemented the Behavioral Based Safety program, which seeks to understand behaviors and perceptions, and to find ways to define breaking points in the system that cause at-risk behaviors. This has reduced lost time incident scores, and it has created more value for our employees.

We significantly increased the amount of funding provided for recycling and women's empowerment: The Foundation contributed almost $20.5 million for recycling programs and committed more than $10 million for women's empowerment.

## From 2017 to 2018, The Coca-Cola Foundation:

· More than tripled the level of funding to recycling projects

· Increased funding to women's empowerment programs by 38%

## Supporting Women Around the World

Empowering women is a priority community investment for The Coca-Cola Foundation. In Bangladesh, United Purpose's program will help women become self-sufficient. The program was awarded a grant of $271,639 to support the economic empowerment of up to 24,000 rural women producers in the Jamalpur District of Bangladesh by expanding its 10 Women's Business Centers in rural and remote areas. The organization will create subcenters and offer training and support hubs for women business owners.

In October of 2018, The Coca-Cola Foundation reached a major milestone, having donated $1 billion over 34 years to more than 2,400 organizations globally. This includes $216 million total funding to protecting the environment, including projects that have created access to clean water for more than 32 million people.

## Providing Clean Water to Cities in Madagascar

Since the early 2000s, the population of Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, has doubled. Many residents carry water from potentially unsafe sources because they live in informal settlements that the city's water network does not reach. The Coca-Cola Foundation is supporting a project to fix leaks in the city's aging water supply and economically empower hundreds of women in cities across Madagascar to operate laundry businesses where residents can wash their clothes in clean water.

Impact: The project will improve water and sanitation services for more than 450,000 people and increase economic empowerment opportunities, especially for women.

## Listen, Learn, Act: Informed Stakeholder Engagement

Partnerships are core to our business and enable us to achieve more together. We can progress faster and with more impact by working with stakeholders who can bring their expertise and know-how to help create a better world.

Our approach to stakeholder engagement is focused on transparency, inclusiveness, consistency and accountability. Our engagement involves many local and global actors across multiple areas: environmental protection, social and economic improvement, industry initiatives involving some of our biggest competitors, and programs working hand-in-hand with communities where we can make a difference.

Input from a diverse range of stakeholders helps to advance and further evolve our sustainability goals. Consistent and open communication is fundamental.

## Stakeholder Engagement Highlights

Conversations and collaborations with our stakeholders propelled our actions in 2018. Below is just a sample of our engagements.

## BOTTLING PARTNERS

Over 250 Coca-Cola system associates are participating in the implementation of World Without Waste. Together with our bottling partners, we've held over a dozen workshops, including in Mexico in June 2018, where teams visited PetStar, the largest food-grade PET bottle-tobottle recycling plant in the world.

## SUPPLIERS

The Coca-Cola Company reaffirmed its commitment to spend $1 billion with diverse partners, and continued to honor leaders in supplier diversity at the annual Partners in Promise awards.

## CONSUMERS

IOC Coca-Cola and the IOC celebrated 90 years of partnership in 2018. Coca-Cola ushered in the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, Korea, starting with the 101-day Olympic torch relay across Korea followed by experiential activations with consumers (giant vending machines, photo cubes) and establishing a legacy water replenishment program to help improve biodiversity and local habitats.

FIFA As an Official FIFA Partner, Coca-Cola created many unforgettable experiences for consumers across the 11 host cities in Russia and in 184 countries around the world, and helped build a lasting community legacy for the games, focused on inclusion, sustainability and youth football development.

## CUSTOMERS

Working with our customers, we create mutual benefit across the business and communities where we operate via our retail research councils, a customer leadership council, and partner collaboration. As a longstanding sponsor of Enactus, a nonprofit representing students across 36 countries, we co-sponsored the 2018 Enactus World Water Race, with our customer partners, to address water and sanitation issues. The winning team: a student group from Brazil working to solve clean water access in the Amazon region.

## INDUSTRY

The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) is a CEO-led organization that helps the world's retailers and consumer goods manufacturers collaborate alongside other key stakeholders, secure consumer trust and drive positive change. We are involved in the Environment and Social Sustainability committees, in which we're driving action on CGF's position on key industry topics, including plastic packaging waste and forced labor.

## EMPLOYEES

Our 700,000+ system employees are the heart of Coca-Cola, with a passion for change. For the past five years, Coca-Cola has sent a group of young system employees from around the world to the annual One Young World (OYW) Summit. With the largest CocaCola group ever, OYW brings together the brightest young people and inspires them to make lasting connections and create positive change. Through followon projects, this group continues to make an impact in their day jobs at Coca-Cola.

## MEDIA

As we continue our journey as a total beverage company, we engaged media to ensure that our story and the evolving consumer landscape was fully understood and told. In December, we hosted CNBC at our Global Headquarters to showcase our transformation, which included interviews with senior leaders and visits to the Coca-Cola Archives and an Atlanta supermarket.

## INVESTORS

We held multiple meetings with the investor community, on topics such as packaging waste, water, climate and human rights, outlining the importance of this work to driving business.

GOVERNMENT

Global leaders gathered once again for the United Nations General Assembly in September and the High-Level Political Meeting in July, and Coca-Cola was there. Coca-Cola leaders met with senior officials to talk about recycling, reducing plastic waste, and water security, as well as reinforce our contribution to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## NGOs

In partnership with Business for Social Responsibility, we analyzed the impact of climate change on Coca-Cola system operations and supply chain, as well as the communities where we operate, focusing on community impacts and ecosystem resilience. In Guatemala, through a collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, we worked with the ministries of environment and agriculture, as well as the forestry institute, to develop climate-smart solutions and policies.

## DISCLOSURE ORGANIZATIONS

We participated in progressive dialogue on effective reporting and disclosure on our business and the long-term interests of our shareowners and other stakeholders, including The Conference Board's Integrated Reporting Working Group and a roundtable entitled "How Can Corporate Sustainability Disclosure Match Investors' Needs?" hosted by Ceres, GRI, Yale University and WBCSD.

Sustainable Development Goals

## The Coca-Cola Company and the Sustainable Development Goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were first launched in 2015 and are a core part of the agenda developed by the 193 member states of the United Nations to work towards the future we want, one where all people thrive within a healthy environment. The 17 goals-geared towards a 2030 timeframe-and their related 169 targets have become an important framework for companies to rally around as they address an array of complex, interrelated global issues.

We recognize that we cannot achieve any one of the SDGs on our own. Yet, as a global company with a wide supply chain and consumer reach, we have a potentially significant role to play in meeting many of these ambitious aims. We have taken a closer look at where we can make direct contributions to the SDGs, whether through collaboration with our partners and industry peers, supplier engagement, or in other places where we have leverage to amplify our positive impacts.

The following table outlines the SDG goals and specific targets to which we most directly contribute, with links to more information.

## A Global Perspective on Climate Change

Climate change is already having an impact on our business at multiple points in our value chain, from our ingredient supply to product distribution, as well as creating water stress in some regions. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report emphasizes the scale and urgency of this challenge, 1 and the recommendations provide specific guidance for businesses to assess the risks and opportunities of climate change.

With this perspective in mind, we are reviewing our relevant goals and impacts across our operations and our wider value chain. We will continue to evaluate and make changes in our operations and throughout the Coca-Cola system to reduce our carbon footprint, and work with partners and suppliers to help slow the warming trend and to increase our resilience as a business.

## . YEAR-OVER-YEAR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS VS. VOLUME GROWTH

As our product sales volume has gone up, our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have gone down. We track our emissions per liter of product sold at a system level, expressed as a ratio (grams of CO$_{2}$ in relation to liters of product produced). This is an important performance metric as we continue to address our climate impacts.

Sales Volume (unit cases in billions)

$^{2}$ The calculation of progress toward our "drink in your hand" goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our "drink in your hand" calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions. 3 2018 data not available as of April 24, 2019

## GOAL

Reduce the carbon footprint of the "drink in your hand" by 25% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline.

## PROGRESS

In 2018, it is estimated we reduced the CO₂ embedded in the Coca-Cola "drink in your hand" by 21% below 2010 levels. 2

## Our Climate Goal: Reducing Our Impact

We set a goal in 2013 to reduce the carbon footprint of the "drink in your hand" by 25% by 2020, when we brought several climate-related initiatives together to manage and improve our impacts.*

## Estimated Share of Carbon Across Our Value Chain

INGREDIENTS 20-25%

PACKAGING 25-30%

MANUFACTURING 10-15%

DISTRIBUTION 5-10%

REFRIGERATION

## 30-35%

* The calculation of progress toward our "drink in your hand" goal has been internally vetted using accepted and relevant scientific and technical methodologies, which are aligned with GHG Protocol Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our "drink in your hand" calculations, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions.

Progress toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions across our manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing is measured toward our "drink in your hand" goal.

Our climate goal is an example of how the Coca-Cola system can work together for a greater impact. Our business units and bottling partners around the world have set reduction targets through 2020, and have been given the flexibility to look across our value chain to implement locally relevant programs designed to help meet their goals. To empower global managers to reach this goal, we have developed a Carbon Scenario Planner to assist in standardizing a forecast methodology for carbon in the system supply chain and to support regional target setting.

We have been working toward implementing a number of recommendations that emerged from the Carbon Scenario Planner, including reducing the GHG emissions of our distribution trucking fleet by introducing a mix of alternative fuels, including electricity, natural gas, diesel electric and biodiesel. Sustainable packaging and recycling-key drivers of our World Without Waste initiative (p. 21), along with sustainable sourcing (p. 30), are also important contributors to our "drink in your hand" progress during 2018.

## Designing for Recycling, Solving for Climate

One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through the design of our packaging. For example, by switching to recycled materials in our PET packaging production we can reduce the carbon footprint of the production process by up to 60%. The design pillar of our World Without Waste initiative is an important part of our climate strategy, and we are making significant progress. And the percentage of recycled material in our packaging is growing. For example, for certain countries in Latin America, the percentages are now as follows:

· 42% in Colombia

· 11% in Guatemala

25% in Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama

This approach to designing recycled materials into our packaging, while building on the strong collection and conversion infrastructure that our system has financed over the past decade, will be critical to delivering on our climate goals and supporting a global shift to more climate-friendly practices.

## The Coca-Cola Company Joins Climate Resilience Platform

In September 2018,

The Coca-Cola Company was pleased to announce our participation in the Climate-Resilient Value Chains Leaders Platform. This platform, led by Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), will enable company value chains and communities to thrive in the face of climate change and allow companies to learn from peers addressing climate risks. Data from CDP notes that 76% of suppliers reported climate risk as having the power to significantly alter their business, underscoring the importance of this collaborative resilience effort.

Through this initiative, we commit to the development of shared methodologies and approaches to embed climate resilience throughout our value chains, to assess physical climate risk and to build resilience for communities, farmers and workers.

## Climate Resilience: Preparing Our Business

Thinking about things from a value chain standpoint is important in mitigating our own emissions. However, along with our efforts to reduce the impacts our business has in relation to climate change, we must also prepare to be resilient as operating conditions evolve. We think of resilience in two ways: (1) our capacity to recover from natural disasters such as hurricanes, droughts or floods, and (2) our ability to respond to the impacts of policy and market shifts brought about in response to climate change.

We are developing a strategy that will enable us to understand our risks and to seize opportunities to take action. To guide this process, we have mapped the potential risks across our entire value chain and on three dimensions: the effects of extreme weather events; the longer-term impacts of a changing climate; and potential changes to markets in which we operate. An overview of this assessment can be found here . This approach aligns with the recommendations put forward by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).*

· Tea and coffee grew 4%, largely driven by innovation and new product launches, including Georgia Craftsman in Japan and Authentic Tea House in China.

Through our Clean Water 24 program, we have provided drinking water to 2 million people in China affected by natural disasters. Since 2013, Clean Water 24 has responded to earthquakes, landslides and other emergencies nearly 200 times, providing water in an average of 11 hours and in as little as six hours. The program transforms the traditional donation format into a life-saving model by integrating the logistical and warehousing advantages of the Coca-Cola China system with the resources of local government and civil society groups. This has enabled us to deliver more than 16 million bottles of drinking water to disaster-stricken communities.

· Coca-Cola Sri Lanka launched "Give Back Life," a PET collection and recycling program using private-public partnerships to help establish a sustainable model for PET bottle recycling in the country.

· Premium innovations such as Sprite Fiber+ in China helped trademark Sprite grow global volume.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative

## Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain non-GAA P finan cial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP finan cial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative

## Independent Accountants' Review Report

## To the Management of The Coca-Cola Company

We have reviewed The Coca-Cola Company Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators (the "Subject Matter") included in the Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators Appendix (pp. 68-70) for the year ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with the Selected Sustainability Indicators Criteria set forth in Note 2 (the "Criteria") included in the Appendix (pp. 68-70). The Coca-Cola Company's management is responsible for the Subject Matter included in the Appendix, in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.

Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements , and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements . Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made

to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.

In performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional

Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA.

As described in Note 3 of the Appendix, non-financial information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators for the year ended December 31, 2018, in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

## Note 1: Scope of Reporting

The Coca-Cola global business system is composed of the Coca-Cola company (TCCC) and 225 bottling partners. TCCC markets, manufactures and sells beverage concentrates, syrups and finished sparkling soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages. The bottling partners manufacture, package, merchandise and distribute the final beverages to customers and/or consumers. TCCC and its bottling partners together are collectively known as the Coca-Cola system (TCCS), or simply "system." TCCC does not own, manage, or control most local bottling companies.

Although the system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective, TCCC strives to positively influence environmental activities and policies throughout the bottling system and to become more transparent by reporting information from both company-owned operations and the broader system. Contract manufacturers are also used to manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola brands.

| Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities) | The criteria can be found in the " Carbon Accounting Manual ." This includes scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide (CO2e) emissions from manufacturing and scope 3  CO2e emissions from franchises. Emissions from standalone (i.e., not co-located) warehouses, distribution centers and offices (based on emissions being lower  than the threshold of five percent of total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) are excluded, CO₂ loss during production and AC/Chiller are excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Water replenish                                     | The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water Partnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water  benefit equivalent to the company's annual global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio of water safely provided to communities and to nature  by the community water partnership portfolio divided by sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed in the 2018 10-K.* Volumetric project  benefits are quantified using TCCC's peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the  Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable Balance  paper  published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013. There are three primary CWP project types: |

| Number of women enabled by the 5by20™ Program       | A woman is considered enabled if she has represented that she is at least in her 16th year of age and has completed a validated program. Locally submitted  programs are validated by The Coca-Cola Company's global 5by20 core team. The Coca-Cola Company's global 5by20 core team and a third party review a  program proposal form and validate that each program has one or more economically enabling activities which meet the needs of the women of the local  community. The Coca-Cola Company's global 5by20 core team then approves the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                                                     | replenish contributions from such efforts cannot reliably be quantified and are not included in the water replenish indicator. As many replenish projects are co -fin anced with partners, TCCC claims the portion of the total water benefits equivalent to the company's cost share for the project. TCCC also claims the annual  water benefits from each project following a benefit duration framework of 15 years as long as the projects remain in productive service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                     | Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced. Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola  system in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well, surface water, and collected rain water.  This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                                                     | The number of women enabled reported for the year ending December 31, 2018 includes women who participated in programs during 2018, as well as  adjustments to the number of women enabled from the previous year ending December 31, 2017. These adjustments are necessary due to further review and/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For 2018, adjustments represented less than 1% of the total annual results  reported. 2018 adjustments will be accounted for in the 2019 reported number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                     | The Coca-Coca Company strives to be transparent and conservative reporting the number of women enabled by only collecting results for validated programs  and taking measures to count women only once during the life of the program. However, there is possibility that a minor number of duplicates could be  included in the reported number of women enabled due to the inherent limitations and legal considerations of gathering personal data and the nature of  projects in remote areas with women in varying situational environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Lost time incident rate | The Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) represents the number of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) per 100 employees. Total LTI is multiplied by 200,000 (100 full time  equivalent employees working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks) then divided by the number of hours worked for the reporting period.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                         | Scope : The scope of reporting is limited to self-reported data collected for TCCC and company-owned or controlled production facilities, distribution centers,  offices and route-to-market (fleet) operations as of December 31, 2018                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                         | Lost Time Incident : A LTI is a self-reported work-related injury or illness, including fatality that results in one or more Lost Days. TCCC's LTIR was determined  as of March 11, 2019, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a minor incident developing into an LTI over time could result in additional LTIs.                                                                                                                                               |
|                         | Lost day : A Lost Day occurs when, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, the employee's work- related injury or illness prevents the person  from being able to work. The first counted Lost Day is the first day following the injury, regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday, and ends when the  person is able, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, to return to work, leaves employment, or reaches 180 Lost Days. |
|                         | Hours worked : The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees. This excludes hours not worked, such as vacation,  holidays, or absences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                         | Employees:  Employees include all hourly, salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of the company (as well as non-payroll contractors and  temporary employees for whom facility or fleet management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details, means, methods and  processes by which the work objective is accomplished).                                                                                              |
|                         | Uncertainties in reported LTIR : LTIR is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for  determining such data. The number of LTIs is based upon employees self-reporting work-related injuries or illnesses to TCCC which may be affected by culture,  societal norms and/or regulations. To the extent a LTI is not self-reported, it would not be included in the LTIR calculation.            |

## Note 3: Measurement Uncertainties

Nonfinancial information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.

## 2018 G RI Content Index

The Global Rep orting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards provi de a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, economic, socia l and governance performance. We prepared this report in ac cordance with the 2016 GRI Standards: Core option. Thi s is the eighth consecutive year that these reporting princi ples have informed our reporting process, and we assess our progress against these guidelines.

In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola Company. For all other indicators, the scope is identified in the referenced documents. Beyond reporting on performance indicators required by the GRI, we report on additional indicators important to our broad range of stakeholders. We review our reporting regularly, and aim to be as responsive as possible to our stakeholders' feedback.
